# TETR.IO rules observance summary by MrZ_26

The`【XX】`in this document is the format for mods. For specifics see the Mods chapter

## Start

This mode doesn't have a global "round", anyone can enter at any time without waiting

## Climbing

This mode's theme is climbing the `Zenith Tower`, the final score is `altitude`  
Upon reaching certain altitudes one will proceed to the next floor

| Floor | Altitude range | Name |
| - | - | :-: |
| Floor 1 | 0m - 50m | Hall of Beginnings |
| Floor 2 | 50m - 150m | The Hotel |
| Floor 3 | 150m - 300m | The Casino |
| Floor 4 | 300m - 450m | The Arena |
| Floor 5 | 450m - 650m | The Museum |
| Floor 6 | 650m - 850m | Abandoned Offices |
| Floor 7 | 850m - 1100m | The Laboratory |
| Floor 8 | 1100m - 1350m | The Core |
| Floor 9 | 1350m - 1650m | Corruption |
| Floor 10 | 1650m+ | Platform of The Gods |

## Climb Speed

`Climb Speed` (called `rank` below) decides the speed of climbing, every action that increases altitude is impacted by its' multiplier bonus. Increasing Climb Speed requires experience

At Climb Speed 1 the multiplier is ×0.25, every rank increase adds another ×0.25 (upon reaching ×2.75 it becomes white with no further difference, but in reality there's no upper limit)

### Experience

| Action | Altitude | Experience | Notes |
| :--: | :--: | :--: | :-- |
| Natural increase | Every second 1m | naturally depletes, see `experience loss` chapter | Will get `stuck`, slowly becomes 0 when 6m~1m away from next floor |
| KO | `15m` | | `8m` in【Expert+】|
| Sending attack | `lines`m | `lines+0.05` experience | |
| Cancelling garbage | | `lines*50%+0.05` experience | During【Expert(+)】【Volatile+】【Duo+】considered as 0 lines |
| Clearing lines | | `min(lines,2)+0.05` experience | ***Doesn't trigger*** during【Expert(+)】, during【All-Spin+】non-spin clears are all considered 1 line |
| `Crossing floors` | 3m | | The judgement condition is when current altitude (including unreleased temporary altitude) ***triggers*** one of sending/cancelling/clearing while less than 2m away from the next floor |

> Altitude gain above excluding `crossing floors` are all affected by your `rank`, for example at the start `rank` is 1, multiplier is ×0.25, every 4 seconds gain 1m  
> `Cancel penalty` (see later on for calculation formula details) will decrease received experience from cancelling. Once `cancel penalty` surpasses `cancel streak minus experience threshold`, for every extra point the 50% in the formula will decrease by 0.5%, to a lowest of 5%. This threshold is 40 when activating【Volatile Garbage(+)】, otherwise when【All-Spin(+)】is activated it's 10, otherwise it's 25.

When gaining altitude, the newly increased altitude will first be stored into a temporary variable, every frame release 10%, at maximum 10m 

The experience required to promote to the next Climb Speed rank is `4*rank`, once your experience meets the conditions your Climb Speed rank increases by one and your experience decreases by the amount previously required

### Skipping ranks

Every frame a rank-skip procedure check is done once:

1. When experience reaches the amount needed to promote, remove the promotion amount of experience and increase rank
2. If the remaining experience is enough to fill the bar again (only happens when releasing tens of B2B, sending a large amount of attack within a single frame), then trigger rank-skipping: immediately raise `experience/required experience` ranks, **and experience isn't removed**
   
    Which means this situation can happen:  
    One frame - Breaking B2B causes large spike and receive lots of experience, promote + skip ranks  
    Next frame - Due to no experience removal from skipping last frame, a large amount of remaining experience causes another promotion + rank-skip  
    Next next frame - Similarly...

> Below is an image made through simulation of the procedure, showing the rank difference situation for gaining a large amount of experience by breaking B2B on different ranks.  
> Excluding the top 20px for row headers, the dimensions of the statistical part is 1000x600, with the top-left corner being the origin  
> Every 1px along the horizontal axis corresponds to 0.01 ranks (1.0 to 10.99), every 3px along the vertical axis corresponds to 1 point of experience (1 to 200)  
> Outputting values as ranks, the first row can be used as a reference for colors, with lighter colors meaning closer to the next rank (e.g., 2.0 red, 2.9 pale red)  

![Rank skip graph](/rank_skip.png)

### Experience loss

Experience will naturally decrease over time, decreasing by `mul*(rank^2+rank)/3600` every frame.  
mul: Regular solo = 3, when activating【Expert(+)】or【Duo+】= 5, when in Duo = 3 + players with Expert Mode on

When promoting a climb speed rank a 5 second `experience loss protection` effect is received, to prevent having very little experience after promotion and suddenly lose it thus demoting right after  
`Promotion fatigue` system: After promoting, the last line's `no loss for 5 seconds` will decrease by 1 second (until 1 second), therefore the effect gets weaker and weaker when repeatedly gaining and losing `ranks`  
To recover you need to reach 50% (peak of the slant on the middle of the experience bar) from a promotion action (rather than demotion), afterwards triggering this effect next time will have 5 seconds

Below are some calculated statistics for convenience:

| `rank` | experience required to promote | seconds to demotion | experience loss per second |【Expert(+)】seconds to demotion |【Expert(+)】loss per second |
| :--: | :-: | :---: | :--: | :---: | :----: |
|  1   | 4   | 40.00 |  0.1 | 24.00 |  0.17 |
|  2   | 8   | 26.67 |  0.3 | 16.00 |  0.50 |
|  3   | 12  | 20.00 |  0.6 | 12.00 |  1.00 |
|  4   | 16  | 16.00 |  1.0 |  9.60 |  1.67 |
|  5   | 20  | 13.33 |  1.5 |  8.00 |  2.50 |
|  6   | 24  | 11.43 |  2.1 |  6.86 |  3.50 |
|  7   | 28  | 10.00 |  2.8 |  6.00 |  4.67 |
|  8   | 32  | 8.89  |  3.6 |  5.33 |  6.00 |
|  9   | 36  | 8.00  |  4.5 |  4.80 |  7.50 |
|  10  | 40  | 7.27  |  5.5 |  4.36 |  9.17 |
|  11  | 44  | 6.67  |  6.6 |  4.00 | 11.00 |
|  12  | 48  | 6.15  |  7.8 |  3.69 | 13.00 |
|  13  | 52  | 5.71  |  9.1 |  3.43 | 15.17 |
|  14  | 56  | 5.33  | 10.5 |  3.20 | 17.50 |
|  15  | 60  | 5.00  | 12.0 |  3.00 | 20.00 |
|  16  | 64  | 4.71  | 13.6 |  2.82 | 22.67 |
|  17  | 68  | 4.44  | 15.3 |  2.67 | 25.50 |
|  18  | 72  | 4.21  | 17.1 |  2.53 | 28.50 |
|  19  | 76  | 4.00  | 19.0 |  2.40 | 31.67 |
|  20  | 80  | 3.81  | 21.0 |  2.29 | 35.00 |
|  21  | 84  | 3.64  | 23.1 |  2.18 | 38.50 |
|  22  | 88  | 3.48  | 25.3 |  2.09 | 42.17 |
|  23  | 92  | 3.33  | 27.6 |  2.00 | 46.00 |
|  24  | 96  | 3.20  | 30.0 |  1.92 | 50.00 |
|  25  | 100 | 3.08  | 32.5 |  1.85 | 54.17 |
|  26  | 104 | 2.96  | 35.1 |  1.78 | 58.50 |

> Note: Based on this formula it can be calculated that while completely idle, when at Climb Speed rank R's maximum experience amount, it can naturally climb `20R/(R+1)` meters (approaches limit of 20), whereas in Expert it is `12R/(R+1)` (approaches limit of 12)

### Appearance

You can view which Climb Speed you're at under the board, a simple text description of the appearances are shown below:

| `rank` | Multiplier | Color | Shape | Hyperspeed notes |
| :-: | :--: | :-: | - | - |
|  1  | 0.25 | none         | a progress bar | |
|  2  | 0.50 | red          | a triangle added below | |
|  3  | 0.75 | orange       | wings added to triangle | |
|  4  | 1.00 | yellow-green | wings increase size | |
|  5  | 1.25 | blue         | wings increase size + add base | |
|  6  | 1.50 | magenta      | wings extend to full size | |
|  7  | 1.75 | light orange | wings become more detailed | lowest `rank` without exiting Hyperspeed |
|  8  | 2.00 | turquoise    | pair of parallelograms added on top | Hyperspeed trigger at f1/f2 |
|  9  | 2.25 | cyan         | two pairs of parallelograms | Hyperspeed trigger at f3/f4 |
| 10  | 2.50 | light purple | three pairs of parallelograms | Hyperspeed trigger at f5 |
| 11  | 2.75 | white        | pair of white triangles added | |

### HYPERSPEED

When the player's `rank` reaches 8/8/9/9/10 in the first five floors, Hyperspeed is activated.  
Once activated there will be a flashy Bejeweled Twist-esque animation, alongside exclusive Hyperspeed music.

A large display appears on the top of the screen showing floor splits and your pace compared to your PB Zenith Speedrun time.  
Reaching floor 10 with Hyperspeed awards a hidden achievement, or when you fall to `rank` 6 or below Hyperspeed disappears.

Hyperspeed is disabled when any mod is activated

If you can't get Hyperspeed through raw APM and have to use surge attack, then based off the image from the previous `rank skip` chapter, one can get the following two conclusions:
- Intentionally waiting until demotion then immediately breaking B2B causes 70 surge attack to almost guarantee Hyperspeed entry (not considering timing may need 80 or even 90)
- Pending garbage should optimally be empty because experience used to cancel will be halved, if done perfectly only 60 is needed to barely enter, in which the 5-second protection may be utilized
    
## Attack target

You can't manually target someone in this mode, but the state of the player will impact the probability of yourself being attacked: `Targeting Factor`  
The higher this value the likelier it is to be attacked, **with a starting value of 3**.

Note that `Targeting Factor` isn't the only factor that affects being attacked by other players, the player's attack target is fully decided by the server, can only say this value is likely one of the main factors

Other factors that could increase the chance of being chosen as another player's target:
- high Climb Speed rank
- smaller altitude difference to other players

### Temporary decrease if in danger

Only in `Easy mode`, check once every 0.25 seconds, if in danger (conditions not understood, probably when your board flashes red, shouldn't be off by a lot) `Targeting Factor` temporarily decreases by 1.5, after leaving danger the 1.5 is added back

### Shift to Targeting Grace (No impact on messiness)

There is a `Targeting Grace` value, when attacked, lines*0.25 amount of `Targeting Factor` gets moved to the targeting grace buffer slot (maximum 3, otherwise doesn't move), then gets moved back later.

When the buffer slot for `Targeting Grace` is filled (hits 3), attack multiplier decreases by 25% (continuous attacks all send 25% less garbage)

The `Targeting Grace` value (linear) will decrease garbage messiness, when fully filled can cause `change between attacks -45%` and `change during attack -18%` 

If `Targeting Grace` has a value, every set amount of time (depending on floor, see table below) 0.25 `Targeting Grace` value is moved back to `Targeting Factor`, meaning the higher the floor, the more the system allows others to attack with garbage lines rapidly.

### Gradual time increase (caps at doubled past 7 minutes)

When time hits 3/5/7 minutes, `Targeting Factor` +1

`Targeting Factor` alongside time/when rapidly filled/change when in danger:

| Time range | Factor | when full | when in danger |
| ----- | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| 0~2 minutes | 3 | -100% | -50% |
| 3~4 minutes | 4 | -75% | -75% |
| 5~6 minutes | 5 | -66% | -60% |
| past 7 minutes | 6 | -50% | -25% |

## Attack, All-Spin, B2B

Clearing 1, 2, 3 lines respectively send 0, 1, 2 attack

Limited to `Easy mode`: “0 combo single 一 +1 attack”, making clearing 1 line also have 1 attack efficiency, can be considered under specific circumstances

Clearing 4 lines sends 4 attack, falls under `special clears` (increases B2B count, used in `Surge Attack`, see next chapter for details)

This mode uses `All-Mini+` spin rules, a subtype of `All-Spin`, other than T every other tetromino's Spins also count as `special clears` 
Only T counts for a regular spin if it passes the 3-corner rule, with a base attack of `2*lines`, spins that don't fulfill 3-corner or non-T tetromino's that pass Immobile detection all count as Mini, with a base attack the same as normal clears, being `lines-1`

All Clears send 3 attack, but also count as +2 B2B (calculated separate from spins) (slightly different from regular TL, TL sends 5 attack but +1 B2B)

Consecutive `special clears` starting from the second one start gathering B2B count, and adds +1 attack

Whether to keep decimals or not uses RNG, in calculating process keep decimals, lastly take the decimal part as the chance for whether or not to round up, for example 1.2 has a 20% final chance to become 2, 80% final chance to become 1

### Surge Attack

When B2B is broken a large attack is created, attack is `B2B count -3`, (or the amount of consecutive special clears count -4) (slightly different in TL, however many B2B however many attack, no -3)

> This is a very important system in qp, really needed in certain situations

### Windup Attack

If a single attack with 8 or more lines is received, this attack will be split into multiple parts and have a warning hint before being received, to prevent easily topping out after targeting multiplier is increased due to various reasons

Splitting rule: Split the attack into several groups of 4 and the remainder portion, at maximum 4 groups (all extra attack are put in the last segment), for example 14 attack will be split into 4+4+4+2

Warning method: When receiving this type of attack start playing warning animations and sound effects  
The amount of sound effects corresponds to the amount of groups the current round's attack split into (for example 3 sounds corresponds to 4+4+n, or 9~12 attack)  
1 second later the attacks start entering the garbage queue, each split is separated by 0.5s

If【Volatile Garbage】is activated, values above related to attack are all multiplied (seems like so, individual circumstances will ±1) ((translation note: I have no idea what the text inside the parentheses mean, sorry if it's unclear.))

## Others related to attack

### Cancel streak

<details>
<summary> The developer doesn't wish for the contents of this chapter to be widely spread, please read cautiously, only players that are highly reliant on loops need to understand </summary>

**The addition of this system can basically be attributed to the appearance of [Mechanical Hearts](https://bilibili.com/opus/997806608970940469) to prevent brainless high-speed looping, since as long as all garbage is cancelled clearing large amounts of items((?)) is possible**

1. There is a `cancel streak` variable, cancelling N garbage lines adds **+N**  
2. All Clears add **+3**  
3.【Directed at Mechanical Hearts】Track whether an S or Z is used when clearing an S/Z Spin, if the tetromino used is the same as at least five of the last six S/Z Spins **+2**  
4.【Directed at Mechanical Hearts】If the I piece is placed vertically at the two edge columns without clearing lines, then check if the four neighbouring blocks on the other column of the same board side, if they're all the I piece's cyan blocks then **+3**  
5. When clearing grey tiles (garbage lines) instantly **becomes 0**  
6. When garbage in queue releases as garbage lines, every line entered through the bottom of the board -3  
7. When an I-Spin clears lines **-2**  
8. When clearing a Quad **-3**, track the column, if different from both of the previous two times (doesn't repeat tracking, only keep new ones) then another **-4**  
9. S/Z Spins clearing lines function identically to when an I piece clears a Quad, just with the rotation center column instead (individual table). When all different **-2**  
10. J/L Spins clearing lines function identically to S/Z Spins
11. Every 30 seconds without doing actions that decrease `cancel streak`: **+5**  
12. Every 75 pieces without doing actions that decreasse `cancel streak`: **+5**  

> Note 1: This value cannot fall under 0
> Note 2: sigh even special weapons toward Mechanical Hearts are being used now, you can announce that Mechanical Hearts is victorious, Garbo what are you doing Garbo (
> Note 3: All conditions above have already been overcome by Mechanical Heart's expansion version, despite requiring learning more changes

Once `cancel streak` reaches certain values, the original 7-bag order becomes modified, adding extra pieces to every bag:
 - 20: O piece
 - 30: random of L/J
 - 40: random of S/Z,【Directed at Mechanical Hearts】when reached for the first time an I5 is added (5-block long bar, limited to once per game) ((translation note: Pentas using I5 are downgraded to Quad))
 - 50: random of L/J
 - 50: random of T/I
 - 60: random of S/Z

Will also shorten garbage wait time, see `garbage wait time` chapter for detail  
Will also increase received garbage amount, see `received amount calculation` chapter for detail

</details>

### Targeting Grace

There is a `Targeting Grace` variable, when attacked increase the same amount of value as received garbage in queue (value through various penalty/protection adjustments, not the original attack amount, excluding【Volatile Garbage+】's 3x isn't counted), until capping at **18**  
`Targeting Grace`'s value decreases `garbage messiness`, although this system is blocked by these reasons: when time reaches 6 minutes in【Expert+】,【Messier Garbage(+)】 
If `Targeting Grace`>0, then it will decrease by 1 a bit of time after “last moment of being attacked”, and refresh “last moment of being attacked” as the current moment, release gaps are shown below:

| Floor | Release every (seconds) | During【Expert+】|
| :-: | :-: | :-: |
| 1  | 4.8 | 1.0 |
| 2  | 3.9 | 0.9 |
| 3  | 2.1 | 0.8 |
| 4  | 1.4 | 0.7 |
| 5  | 1.3 | 0.6 |
| 6  | 0.9 | 0.5 |
| 7  | 0.6 | 0.4 |
| 8  | 0.4 | 0.3 |
| 9  | 0.3 | 0.2 |
| 10 | 0.2 | 0.1 |

### Received amount calculation

When attacked the amount is adjusted based off various factors, before lastly appearing in the garbage queue, specific process listed below:

#### 1. Altitude penalty

Calculate `critical altitude` = `max(min(attacker's altitude,3500), min(altitude-1000,2000))`

If altitude is greater than `critical altitude`, multiply received attack by `100% + 0.4% *(altitude - critical altitude)^2) / (altitude + critical altitude)`

#### 2. Partner penalty

If【Duo(+)】is activated and the partner is dead, multiply received attack by `150%`

#### 3. Cancel penalty (pattern penalty)

First fetch `penalty coefficient`  
Default 0.001  
With【Volatile Garbage】without【All-Spin】: 0.0003  
With【All-Spin】without【Volatile Garbage】: 0.002

Attacks add `penalty coefficient * cancel streak ^ 2`, although increase amount won't surpass:
- Basic upper limit: Check floor count, first 7 floors is **floor+3**, unlimited after eighth floor  
- If currently in windup: choose lower value compared to 6  
- If【Volatile】is enabled multiply by 2

#### 4. Carrying protection

If【Duo(+)】is activated and bonus altitude contribution percentage through sending/KOs is less than 20%, multiply received attack by `55%+contribution%`

#### 5. Targeting Grace protection

If `Targeting Grace` is over 8, multiply sent attack by `100% - 5%*(Targeting Grace-8)`

#### Result

Multiply attack by `attack received multiplier`, then round (use decimals as weighted randomness in qp), spawn in garbage queue

## Garbage messiness

The chance for garbage holes to continue. The higher this value, the more likely each line's hole is different

TETR.IO's garbage messiness system is decided by two numbers:  
“every line in the same attack has an X% chance to reroll the position”, “different attacks have a Y% chance to reroll the position” 

In TL X=0, Y=100%, which means the garbage lines in the same attack are almost always on different columns (unchanged if rerolled on the same position, 10%) 
But in qp2 these two numbers aren't as extreme, meaning you'll feel the position of garbage holes aren't that related to the attacks in queue.

In qp2, by default Y=2.5*X, which means between received garbage attacks there's a higher chance (2.5 times) to be on a different column

The `garbage messiness` in this page is exactly this X, which can be affected by various factors

| Element | Impact value |
| :-: | :-: |
| Floor | `Floor*3%`, in【Expert(+)】`Floor*5%` |
|【Messier Garbage(+)】| +25% (100%) |
|【All-Spin+】| +30% |
|【Expert+】's 11 minute Fatigue `full scatter` effect | =100% (calculations above can surpass 100%, this effect overwrites) |
| `Targeting Grace` (calculated when finally spawns) | every point of `Targeting Grace` decreases Y by 3.75%, X by 1.5% |

> When `Targeting Grace` hits 18 points, Y is decreased by 67.5%, X by 27%  
> Genuinely didn't write in the wrong order, quite weird here, probably need to pull a table to observe garbage messiness changes deduced from various factors   
> After receiving the `full scatter` effect when both values are overwritten as 100%, instead between attacks it's even more likely to be on the same column, very interesting

## Garbage Favor

Decides the choosing trend for garbage hole positions. This value can be positive or negative: the more it is when positive, garbage hole positions will be chosen easier to dig, same reasoning, the more it is negative the harder to dig

When this value is 0 (TL etc. modes' normal condition), garbage hole positions are evenly randomly chosen. If `Garbage lines aren't continuous` (messiness_nosame, for example custom room options) is activated at the same time, then it will avoid the last column picked  
In qp2, this value's default formula is `33-floor*3`, the further the harder

When activating【Expert(+)】, this value -33, which means evenly random at the start  
When activating【Messier Garbage(+)】, this value -25  
When activating【Volatile Garbage+】, this value is locked to 50 for the entire run

> The worst condition is Floor 10【Expert】【Messier Garbage】's -55   
> The easiest is【Volatile Garbage+】's 50

Specific garbage hole position choosing process:
1. Calculate every columns' `dig difficulty score`
    1. If the column is one of the highest ones and doesn't have empty spaces, the `dig difficulty score` is 0
    1. Find the column's lowest empty space, find the height of the board's highest spot
    1. `dig difficulty score = height difference between empty space and highest spot + 5*empty space to highest garbage hole's horizontal distance`
1. Rank the ten columns according to their `dig difficulty score`, put the lowest which is the easiest to dig in the front (randomly sort for same values) (used to put highest in front)
1. Use `Garbage Favor` to calculate probability spread, formula is `weight[i] = 10 + favor * (1 - i / 4.5)`, consider negative values 0
    1. You can observe the graph in this [Desmos document](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/yfzabziltb)
    1. The X axis is the column numbers (left side column 0 is the easiest to dig, right side column 9 is the hardest to dig), the Y axis is the weight, use the slider at the left side to tune the favor value
1. Decide a column as the garbage hole position via the weight calculation of the previous step

> In an old version, the use of the value was inverted, being the higher the harder
> After fixing, all categories with【Expert】and*【Messier Garbage】will become harder to an extent, although after fixing, old records weren't deleted ((*translation note: should be or))

## Garbage gathering
 
There is a `garbage gathering` toggle, enabled when `garbage messiness` <=15% and within the first 5 floors
 
When enabled, garbage hole positions will never be on the two leftmost or rightmost columns, which means it's always on columns 3~8

## Garbage wait time

When attacked garbage lines will wait in queue for a certain amount of time before entering a triggerable state, during this state placing pieces that don't clear lines causes garbage to enter through the board: translucent yellow → translucent red → opaque red (triggerable)  
Waiting time is decided by the floor or certain mods, for specific values see below:

| Floor |  Regular (Non-Expert)   | 【Expert(+)】  |【Messier+/Volatile+/Double Hole+】| Other【Mod+】|
| :-: | :----------: | :---------: | :-------------: | :-----: |
|  1  |  5.0s (300f)  | 2.2s (132f) |   **2.5s**    |**2.5s**|
|  2  |  4.5s (270f)  | 2.0s (120f) |   **2.5s**    |**2.5s**|
|  3  |  4.0s (240f)  | 1.8s (108f) |   **2.5s**    |**2.5s**|
|  4  |  3.5s (210f)  | 1.6s  (96f) |   **2.5s**    |**2.5s**|
|  5  |  3.0s (180f)  | 1.4s  (84f) |   **2.5s**    |**2.5s**|
|**6**|**2.5s (150f)**| 1.2s  (72f) |   **2.5s**    |**2.5s**|
|  7  |  2.0s (120f)  | 1.0s  (60f) |   **2.5s**    | `2.0s` |
|  8  |  1.5s  (90f)  | 0.8s  (48f) |   **2.5s**    | `1.5s` |
|  9  |  1.0s  (60f)  | 0.6s  (36f) |   **2.5s**    | `1.0s` |
| 10  |  0.5s  (30f)  | 0.4s  (24f) |   **2.5s**    | `0.5s` |

> Note: Because garbage has to switch twice to enter a triggerable state, the statistics in the source code are half of the table above

### Cancelling penalty (didn't see that coming right, here too)

When 'cancel streak' is over 25, received garbage' countdown time will be halved

## Fatigue

To prevent a game from being too long, starting from 8 minutes every minute adds a negative effect

| Time | Negative effect | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  8:00 | +2 permanent garbage | FATIGUE SETS IN… +2 PERMANENT LINES |
|  9:00 | +25% attack received multiplier | YOUR BODY GROWS WEAK… receive 25% more garbage |
|  10:00 | +3 permanent garbage (total 5) | ALL SENSES BLUR TOGETHER… +3 PERMANENT LINES |
|  11:00 | +25% attack received multiplier | YOUR CONSCIOUSNESS FADES… receive 25% more garbage |
|  12:00 | +5 permanent garbage (total 10) | THIS IS THE END. +5 PERMANENT LINES |

> In【Expert+】Fatigue effects are different, see later below for specifics

## Mods

In this page `Easy mode` means not activating【Expert(+)】and not activating【Mod+】

Mods are ways you can increase the difficulty before starting a run, with basically only downsides and no upsides, but activating mods (or specific mod combinations) and reaching certain altitudes can grant achievements

There are a total of 9 mods, each corresponding with a special effect that can be individually toggled, with the setting having them as Tarot Cards, a description will be written after the mod name below, there will also be a table for convenience at the end of the chapter

### Expert Mode (The Emperor)

> A display of power for those willing to bear its burden.

- Harder to receive altitude and experience
- `Garbage messiness` is increased
- `Garbage Favor` is decreased
- Rising garbage animation is removed, instead spawns instantaneously (same as TL)
- Removes system of decreasing `Targeting Factor` when in danger

### No Hold (Temperance)

> Use each piece as they come and embrace the natural flow of stacking.

- Disables holding

### Messier Garbage (Wheel of Fortune)

> The only constant in life is change.

- `Garbage messiness` increases
- `Garbage Favor` decreases

### Gravity (The Tower)

> What will you do when it all comes crumbling down?

- Gravity noticeably increases
- Lock delay table for the ten floors (unit frames): 30, 29, 28, 27, 26, 24, 22, 20, 18, 16

### Volatile Garbage (Strength)

> Match great obstacles with greater determination.

- `Attack multiplier` and `cancel multiplier` are both x2

> Can be summarized as received garbage on the board is x2  
> Because it just increases the amount of garbage lines, therefore also indirectly decreases garbage messiness, so this mod can speed up climbing progress at the start, but poses too much of a threat in the endgame so whether its good or not is dependent on the specific type of play

### Double Hole Garbage (The Devil)

> Redefine your limits or succumb to his chains.

- Every line of garbage has a chance to have two holes

### Invisible (The Hermit)

> When the outside world fails you, trust the voice within to light a path.

- Pieces placed become invisible  
- Every 5 seconds the whole board flashes which can be convenient for digging

### All-Spin (The Magician)

> Inspiration is nothing short of magic.

- Non-T tetromino's Spins can be like T providing lines*2 of base attack (see the start for Spin detection rules)
- Whenever clearing lines (accurately it should be when a piece locks and action text appears, non-line-clear Spins can also trigger), if it's the exact same as the action text in the top-left corner, then a special full garbage line instantly appears as punishment, with a reverse tally of `current floor+5` on a random position, when the player does an unpunished line clear -1, upon hitting zero it turns into a regular one-hole garbage line, with the garbage hole on the same position as where the number was

> Only mod that can give a more positive effect after the player reaeches a certain skill rank

### Duo (The Lovers)

> Love, and resign yourself to the fate of another.

- Players with supporter can invite others to play with themselves in this two-player mode
- To the perspective of one person, most output values will be halved, for example sent attacks and accumulated experience etc.
- After both players die the game ends, but after one player dies the other player can do revive task(s) to revive their teammate

There is a `accumulated revive difficulty` variable, when reviving increase (First five floors +1, floors six to nine +2, floor 10 +3)

When needing to revive calculate revive difficulty score = `floor+accumulated revive difficulty`, and then select a group based off the score, lastly choose tasks from the list above and randomize order:
 
1. F
2. F F
3. F F F
4. F F E
5. F E E
6. E E E
7. E E D
8. E D D
9. D D D
10. D D C
11. D C C
12. C C C
13. C C B
14. C B B
15. B B B
16. B B A
17. A B A (Upper bound, and is fixed at ABA order without shuffling)

## Mod+

Every mod has a corresponding buffed mod, needing 30,000 meters climbed with the mod to unlock (activating multiple mods can accumulate for them at the same time)
【Duo+】is special, see the corresponding chapter

All buffed mods can only be played solo, and cannot be stacked on other mods

### Unlocking as soon as possible

If you want to unlock all buffed mods as quick as possible it's recommended to activate multiple at the same time, below is a reference strategy (if you can smoothly get a few f10 with all of the mods individually)

First round: `【Messier Garbage】【Gravity】【Double Hole Garbage】【All-Spin】` activate these four and rely on All-Spin's fierce output, try not to let garbage lines enter, finish 30,000 meters. If unafraid, you can also bring `【Invisible】` too, otherwise it later needs to be cleared by itself
    
Second round: Then individually play `【Expert】【No Hold】【Invisible】`, if capable you can also combine them (despite being harder progress is doubled, you can calculate the efficiency then decide), if only activating one mod then recommend activating `【Volatile】` too, try to tank more garbage and use Quads to downstack to climb much faster (at the same time try to send rather than cancel, more rewards, but even cancelling is doubled so recommend activating Volatile)
    (altitude/time, multiply by 2 with Expert) to decide whether or not to accumulate for Expert Mode incidentally, if possible then bring it, otherwise later on it needs to be cleared by itself
    
Additionally if some achievements haven't been played much you can also try them, such as`【Expert】【No Hold】【Double Hole Garbage】`, which allows putting the first round's `【Double Hole Garbage】` into the second round, being more meaningful

### Introduction to some effects that will appear later

1. `Garbage line protection`: (Only appears in certain mods)    
Every line of `Non-permanent garbage lines` (includes lines with clearable ***grey*** blocks) will cause `Targeting Factor` to decrease by 0.5, at maximum decrease by 2.5 (due to the starting value being 3, so for these modes you rarely get attacked in the opening), check every 0.25 seconds

### Expert+ (The Tyrant)

> Fear, oppression, and limitless ambition.

On top of all limits of the original basis,  
- KO base attack is decreased from 15m to 8m
- Climb speed no longer gains altitude over time, sending attack and KOs are required to receive height
- `Targeting Grace` releases faster (see `Targeting Grace` related chapters for detail)
- Adds a descent system, altitude decreases over time, although it gets blocked by each floor's borderline so you can't fall to the previous floor
- When you stay on the same floor for over 60 seconds, every second permanently gain 0.5% multiplier to be attacked (for example after accumulating the effect for 200 seconds all incoming garbage is doubled)
- Fatigue system becomes even more harsh

|     Floor     |  Descent speed | Corresponding `rank` and spm |
| :--------: | :-----: | :---------: |
|  1 (0m)    | 0.6 m/s | 3 & 48spm |
|  2 (50m)   | 0.8 m/s | 4 & 48spm |
|  3 (150m)  | 1.1 m/s | 4 & 66spm |
|  4 (300m)  | 1.5 m/s | 5 & 72spm |
|  5 (450m)  | 2.0 m/s | 5 & 96spm |
|  6 (650m)  | 2.6 m/s | 6 & 104spm |
|  7 (850m)  | 3.3 m/s | 6 & 132spm |
|  8 (1100m) | 4.1 m/s | 6 & 164spm |
|  9 (1350m) | 5.0 m/s | 7 & 171spm |
| 10 (1650m) | 6.0 m/s | 7 & 206spm |

> Descent speed formula is `(floor^2+floor+10)/20`  
> `rank` and spm are only for reference, in reality cancelling doesn't count for spm so it can't be achieved, after the fifth-sixth floor you have to rely on 3-digit surge APM to continue climbing  ((translation note: SPM = Sent Per Minute))  
> During gameplay descent looks like it has acceleration, but it's only a visual effect, in reality it's still even

| Time | Negative effect | Text description |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  6:00 | garbage becomes messier (disables `Targeting Grace` effect) | YOUR POWER SLIPS… garbage received becomes messier |
|  7:00 | +25% attack received multiplier | WHISPERS OF DISCONTENT SPREAD… receive 25% more garbage |
|  8:00 | +3 permanent garbage | PROTESTERS LINE THE STREETS… +3 PERMANENT LINES |
|  9:00 | +25% attack received multiplier | YOUR CLOSEST ALLIES DEFECT… receive 25% more garbage |
|  10:00 | +5 permanent garbage (total 8) | PARANOIA CLOUDS YOUR JUDGEMENT… +5 PERMANENT LINES |
|  11:00 | garbage becomes noticeably messier (receive `full scatter` effect) | THE REVOLUTION HAS BEGUN… garbage received becomes much messier |
|  12:00 | +12 permanent garbage (total 20) | THE END OF AN ERA. +12 PERMANENT LINES |

### No Hold+ (Asceticism)

> A detachment from even that which is moderate.

- Holding is disabled
- 1 piece preview
- No piece shadow
- Completely random piece generation
- Spins all count as Mini (base attack of `lines-1`)
- Garbage holes all become 2-wide style

### Messier Garbage+ (Loaded Dice)

> In a rigged game, your mind is the only fair advantage.

- `Garbage messiness` is increased 
- Line clear delay increases from 0 to 1.15 seconds
- The starting board state becomes a fixed pattern of six circles:
- Activates `Garbage line protection`

```
Starting pattern：
..........
.XXX..XXX.
.X.X..X.X.
.XXX..XXX.
..........
.XXX..XXX.
.X.X..X.X.
.XXX..XXX.
..........
.XXX..XXX.
.X.X..X.X.
.XXX..XXX.
..........
```

### Gravity (Freefall)

> The ground you stood on never existed in the first place.

- 20G from the start (lock delay table for the ten floors: 24, 22, 20, 18, 16, 15, 14, 13, 12, 11)

### Volatile Garbage+ (Last Stand)

> Strength isn't necessary for those with nothing to lose.

- Received attack multiplier becomes 3x (notice: `cancelling multiplier` isn't changed)
- 14 high playfield
- Garbage hole positions have two warnings
- `Garbage Favor` is locked to a very high value, and `garbage gathering` is permanently enabled

### Double Hole Garbage+ (Damnation)

> Neither the freedom of life or peace of death.

- The starting board state becomes 12-row checkerboard garbage lines
- Garbage lines become messy garbage lines with 3~4 random grey blocks  
- Cannot attack (including cancelling). Unless during: clearing garbage lines, or with the “BLIGHTED” effect
- Spin system is changed to `T-Spin+`
- BLIGHTED: Received after clearing garbage lines, when enabled the next line clear's attack *1.75, if doesn't clear garbage lines buff disappears and +1 attack
- Board has 4 fixed garbage lines, when cleared spontaneously appears again
- Activates `garbage line protection` (er... isn't there always 4 lines)

### Invisible+ (The Exile)

> Never underestimate blind faith.

- Pieces placed are invisible (but the board doesn't flash anymore)
- Only the top three garbage lines are visible  
- Receive 3 lines of garbage at the start by the system

### All-Spin+ (The Warlock)

> Into realms beyond heaven and earth.

- Even more strict consecutive same clear penalty: only track Spin's lines cleared count (including 0) or Void actions, as long as two consecutive attacks are the same then 20 penalty lines are added leading to instant death  
- After reaching B2B x 4, any Spin (including ones that don't clear lines) +2 attack, and B2B counter can be increased without clearing lines  
- All non-Spin clears are called “Void”, no attack ((translation note: Void acts as a Single but doesn't penalize if a Spin Single is done previously))
- Receive 10 lines of garbage at the start by the system  
- `Garbage messiness` is increased
- Activates `Garbage line protection`
- 【Seriously?】If 800m is reached and digged garbage row count is under 5, sending attack no longer gains experience

- Climb Speed rank is locked to a highest of 4 (normally unlimited)
